# rost
## A simple os written in rust
The project is more of a proof of concept than an actually usable operating system. 

## Building
### Requirements
Rust nightly and QEMU

build with ```cargo bootloader``` or run with ````cargo run```
The os can also be ran on bare metal however i would not recommend it since you need a ps2 keyboard and I have no guarantee of your hardware not breaking.
